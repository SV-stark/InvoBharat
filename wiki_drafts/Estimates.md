# Estimates & Quotes

Estimates allow you to send a price quote to a client before doing the work. If the client accepts, you can convert it to an invoice instantly.

## 📝 Creating an Estimate

1.  Navigate to the **Estimates** tab.
2.  Click **+ New Estimate**.
3.  The form is identical to the Invoice form (Client, Items, Tax).
    *   *Difference*: It doesn't affect your Revenue or Tax Liability until converted.
    *   *Numbering*: Uses a separate sequence (e.g., EST-001).

## ⚡ Converting to Invoice

When a client approves your quote:
1.  Open the Estimate.
2.  Click the **Convert to Invoice** button.
3.  A new **Invoice** is created with all the details copied over.
4.  You can now edit the final invoice (e.g., adjust dates) and save it.
5.  The original Estimate is marked as *Converted* or *Closed*.

## 📄 Sharing
Like invoices, Estimates can be exported as **PDFs** to share via email or WhatsApp.
