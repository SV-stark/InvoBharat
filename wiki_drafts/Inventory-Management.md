# Inventory Management

The **Inventory** (or "Items") section allows you to pre-define goods and services. This speeds up invoicing and ensures consistent pricing and tax application.

## 📦 Adding an Item

1.  Go to the **Inventory** tab.
2.  Click **+ Add Item**.

### Item Details
*   **Name**: Product or Service name (e.g., "Web Development", "Wireless Mouse").
*   **Type**: Goods or Service.
*   **Unit**: e.g., pcs, hrs, kgs, month.
*   **Price**: The standard selling price (excluding tax).

### 🏛️ Tax & HSN/SAC
*   **HSN/SAC Code**: Harmonized System of Nomenclature code. This is mandatory for GST compliance.
    *   *Search*: You can search the built-in database for common HSN/SAC codes.
*   **Tax Rate**: Select the applicable GST slab:
    *   0% (Exempt)
    *   5%
    *   12%
    *   18% (Standard for most services)
    *   28% (Luxury goods)

## ⚡ Using in Invoices

Once added to Inventory, you don't need to remember the rate or HSN code. Just select the item name in the Invoice form, and InvoBharat will auto-fill everything.
